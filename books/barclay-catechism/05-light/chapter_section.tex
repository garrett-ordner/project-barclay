	Q. Where is God's love toward fallen and lost men?

	A. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. [John 3:16]\qVerse{John}{3}{16}

	God's love manifested in this: That God sent his only begotten Son into the world so we could live through him. [1 John 4:9]\qVerse{IJohn}{4}{9}

	Q. What does the Bible mean by "World"? Every man, or only a few?

	A. Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels in order to die with glory and honor, tasted death for every man, by the grace of God. [Hebrews 2:9]\qVerse{Hebrews}{2}{9}

	If a man sins, he has an advocate with God in Jesus Christ, the righteous one; and he is the atonement for our sins, and not just ours, but the sins of the whole world. [1 John 2:1-2]\qRange{IJohn}{2}{1}{2}

	Q. It seems the apostle John is speaking plainly by mentioning the whole world. This must not only include the saints, but everyone else, since he clearly distinguishes the world from himself and all the saints he was writing to. What does Paul say about this?

	A. Christ within you is the hope of glory, and we preach of him, warning and teaching every man, so we that every man can be made perfect in Christ. [Colossians 1:27-28]\qRange{Colossians}{1}{27}{28}

	I strongly recommend that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who wishes all men would come to the knowledge of the truth; who gave himself as a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. [1 Timothy 2:1,3-6]\qVerse{ITimothy}{2}{1}\textsuperscript{,}\qRange{ITimothy}{2}{3}{6}

	Q. And what does the apostle Peter say about this?

	A. Tell them that God says, "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but wish that the wicked would turn from their way and live." [Ezekiel 33:11]\qVerse{Ezekiel}{33}{11}

	God is gracious and compassionate; he is slow to anger, and very merciful. God is good to all, and His tender mercy is shown in His works. [Psalms 145:8-9]\qRange{Psalms}{145}{8}{9}

	In Christ, God reconciled the world to himself, not counting their sins against them. [2 Corinthians 5:19]\qVerse{IICorinthians}{5}{19}

	Q. These Scriptures seem to assert that God's love is offered to all, so that everyone could be saved by Christ. What, then, can be said about those who claim that God and Christ intended many men should never be saved; and that Christ's life and death were never intended for these men's justification, but rather would serve to condemn them, as God so desired, withholding salvation from the moment they were born?  What does Scripture say about this?

	A. God didn't send his son into the world to condemn the world, but so that through Him the world could be saved. [John 3:17]\qVerse{John}{3}{17}

	I come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me doesn't abide in darkeness. If any man hears my words and doesn't believe him, I don't judge him for that, because I didn't come to judge the world, but to save it. [John 12:46-47]\qRange{John}{12}{46}{47}

	Q. Then what Scripture led such men to believe so wrongly?

	A. Before Jacob and Esau were even born, before they had done good or evil, in order that God's purpose in election could stand, not by their works but by God's will, Rebekah was told, "The older child will serve the younger, because I love Jacob and hate Esau." [Romans 9:11-13]\qRange{Romans}{9}{11}{13}

	Q. But the referenced Scripture only says that before the children were born, the older would serve the younger. The part about loving Jacob and hating Esau is taken from Malachi, who wrote them centuries after Jacob and Esau had died. Doesn't Scripture mention any other reason God hated Esau besides his own will? What does Paul say about this elsewhere in Scripture?

	A. No one should be immoral like Esau, who sold his birthright for a meal, since as a result, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was instead rejected. [Hebrews 12:16-17]\qRange{Hebrews}{12}{16}{17}

	Q. These men allege that Adam's sin damned many people, even children. But doesn't Scripture say that Christ's death could heal just as much as Adam's sin could damn?

	A. If one man's sin could damn many, God's grace through Jesus Christ could do so much more. By one man's sin, all were condemned, but by one man's righteousness, God gave everyone the chance to be justified. [Romans 5:15-19]\qRange{Romans}{5}{15}{19}

	Q. The proves that Christ's death can make up for Adam's sin. Why, then, are some still condemned?

	A. He who believes in Christ is not condemned, but he who doesn't believe is already condemned, because he hasn't believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. [John 3:18]\qVerse{John}{3}{18}

	There are those unrighteous who will die, becuase they haven't received God's truth to be saved. For this, God will delude them with a lie, that those who didn't believe the truth but took pleasure in evil will be damned. [2 Thess. 2:10-12]\qRange{IIThessalonians}{2}{10}{12}

	Q. Seeing that Scripture testifies that God intended love and mercy for all through Christ, is the Gospel intended for everyone, in that they are able to receive God's grace?

	A. Continue in grounded faith, and don't be pulled away from the hope of the Gospel you've heard, which was preached to every creature, and of which I, Paul, am a minister. [Colossians 1:23]\qVerse{Colossians}{1}{23}

	Q. What is the Gospel?

	A. I'm not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is God's power of salvatoin for everyone who believes it. [Romans 1:16]\qVerse{Romans}{1}{16}

	Q. Is this Gospel hidden?

	A. If our Gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those who are lost, whose unbelieving minds God has blinded so that the light of this glorious Gospel would not shine on them. [2 Cor. 4:3-4]\qRange{IICorinthians}{4}{3}{4}

	Q. But hasn't this light come into the world? And aren't men condemned because they hate the light, not because it is hidden from them?

	A. The condemnation is this: Light has come into the world, but men prefer darkness. [John 3:19]\qVerse{John}{3}{19}

	Q. Why do they love darkness?

	A. They love darkness because their deeds are evil. [John 3:19]\qVerse{John}{3}{19}

	Q. Is every man given light by this light?

	A. John the Baptist was not the light, but was sent to bear witness of the true light which gives light to everyone in the world. [John 1:8-9]\qRange{John}{1}{8}{9}

	Q. Does this light discover everything?

	A. Everything the light shines on is made visible, and everything it shines on becomes a light. [Ephesians 5:13]\qVerse{Ephesians}{5}{13}
